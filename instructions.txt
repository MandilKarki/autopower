Project Title: AI-Powered Intelligent PDF Report Generator
Overview

This project aims to develop a modular AI-powered PDF Generator that can compile clean, coherent, and customized reports using user input, AI-generated content, uploaded data, and extracted information from external documents. The system will feature both a graphical user interface (GUI) and an API for seamless integration and automation.
Core Features
1. User Input & Configuration (GUI + API)

    Collect inputs via GUI or API such as:

        Report Title

        Section Titles

        User-provided content

        Preferences for layout, formatting, and included sections

2. AI-Generated Content

    Use an LLM to:

        Generate coherent and context-aware text for sections like introductions, summaries, or analysis

        Assist with paraphrasing or enhancing user-provided notes

        Optionally expand on raw keywords or bullet points to full paragraphs

3. Document Retrieval & Integration (RAG)

    Ingest reference documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT)

    Index content into ChromaDB as embeddings

    Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to:

        Pull relevant context

        Answer queries for specific sections

        Include factual, cited content in the final PDF

4. Data Visualization

    Accept structured data (CSV, Excel, JSON)

    Auto-generate meaningful graphs (bar, pie, line, etc.)

    Allow users to select graph types and customize titles/labels

    Insert visuals into the final PDF in proper layout sections

5. PDF Assembly

    Generate a polished PDF with:

        Cover page, table of contents

        Structured content (headings, paragraphs, AI-generated sections)

        Visualizations and captions

        Footer, page numbers, logo, and metadata

Architecture & Stack (Initial Implementation)

    Backend: Python (FastAPI or Flask)

    Frontend: Streamlit (for simplicity and speed)

    AI Layer: OpenAI or Ollama LLMs via API

    Vector Store: ChromaDB

    Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

    Graphing: Matplotlib or Plotly

    PDF Generation: pdfkit (HTML to PDF) or WeasyPrint

Phase 1 Scope

    Basic working prototype with:

        Simple Streamlit GUI

        API endpoint to generate PDF

        One AI section generator

        One visualization from CSV

        Document ingestion and retrieval via Chroma

    Clean, readable PDF with user content, AI content, and graphs
